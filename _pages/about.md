Welcome! I'm Anna Clarkson, a data scientist currently pursuing my Master's degree at [Willamette University](https://willamette.edu/computing/programs/data-science-ms/index.html). Through the MSDS program I've honed my skills in data analysis and visualization, as well as in tools such as R, SQL, and Python. I'm also a Senior Research Analyst on the Audience Insights team at [NPR](http://www.npr.org), where I act as the primary point of contact for broadcast and digital metrics reporting for Corporate Sponsorship and Development teams. My email and LinkedIn can be found below, and my resume is [here](assets/pdf/Anna Clarkson Resume 2024.pdf).
