This is the final project for the Data Visualization course. Working with a partner, we used a [Washington Post database](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-shootings) that provided data for school shootings beginning with Columbine in April 1999 (their article is [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/school-shootings-database/). We analyzed and visualized the data in R. Our visualizations can be seen below, and the full project is available [here](https://github.com/annaclarkson1/annaclarkson1.github.io/blob/master/_projects/DATA%20502%20-%20An%20Analysis%20on%20School%20Shootings.pdf).
